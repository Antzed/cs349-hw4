In this plot we can see that Q Learner have a higher reward per step. Both algorithm reached the most optimal run before step 20. MAB got to that most optimal solution faster.

In this plot we can see on average Q learner received higher rewards. Q leaner reach the reward peak at around 50 steps. MAB on the other Stayed pretty consistent. This seem to imply that Q learner found the best solution where as MAB got stuck.

In this plot we can see that on average Bandit performed better than the Q learner.  Both algorithm followed the same type of trend but MAB consistantly get higher rewards while Q learner's reward hovers at a lower level.
